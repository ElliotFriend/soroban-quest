## Feeling Lost?

There's a lot going on here! If you're feeling confused, or you're not sure how
this whole thing is supposed to work, don't fret. We have a couple options for
you:

### Re-Visit the Pioneer Quest

please checkout our [pioneer quest][pioneer]. It covers the basic structure of
this repository, all the tools you'll need, and the process of getting
everything working together.

It's an important resource to keep handy during all these live
quests. Some of the most important bits you'll need to know from it:

- Understanding what a "Gitpod workspace" even is, and how we've set it up for
  you to successfully complete these quests.
- Using the `sq` CLI to login to your Stellar Quest account, retrieve new
  quests, verify quests you've worked on, and more.
- Interacting with a Soroban sandbox, as well as the Futurenet, from within this
  gitpod workspace.

If you feel lost on any of that, you could probably use a refresher. Go ahead,
[be a pioneer][pioneer] once more. We don't judge!

### Join us on Discord

We have a thriving, active, and *extremely* helpful discord community! Join the
[Stellar Quest discord server][discord], where you'll find so many friendly
folks who will help get you on your way! This discord server is an excellent
place to ask questions, learn the ropes, find tools, and meet others on the same
journey as you.

In the [Stellar Developers discord server][dev-discord], you will also find a
large, active, and helpful community! We have recently announced a $100M Soroban
Adoption Fund, which SDF created to support the growth and development of the
Soroban ecosystem. We'll be sharing more about additional programs on the
Stellar Dev discord in the not-too-distant future, so make sure to join today to
be the among the first to hear those announcements. This is yet another way for
you to **Tinker and Earn** XLM on Soroban! Many of the people who are *creating*
the Soroban platform are there, and willing to answer questions, too! Talk about
"straight from the horse's mouth"!!

**Please Note:** While there are people in the larger Stellar Ecosystem that are
interested in token speculation, XLM farming, etc. these discord servers are not
designed for those conversations. The *Stellar Quest* discord server is an
excellent place to begin or advance your blockchain education. The *Stellar
Developers* discord server is a great place to further your education, meet
other developers, and build projects on the Stellar network.
