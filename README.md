## Welcome

Welcome to our Soroban Quest! We are beyond excited you've joined us. We've
worked hard to make this a productive, interesting, and most-of-all useful
learning experience for you!

These quests are going to be fun, exciting, and *interesting* to be sure! We're
so thrilled you're here.

Enjoy!

## Feeling Lost?

There's a lot going on here! If you're feeling confused, or you're not sure how
this whole thing is supposed to work, don't fret. We have a couple options for
you:

### Re-Visit the Pioneer Quest

please checkout our [pioneer quest][pioneer]. It covers the basic structure of
this repository, all the tools you'll need, and the process of getting
everything working together.

It could probably be an important resource to keep handy during all these live
quests. Some of the most important bits you'll need to know from it:

- Understanding what a "Gitpod workspace" even is, and how we've set it up for
  you to successfully complete these quests.
- Using the `sq` CLI to login to your Stellar Quest account, retrieve new
  quests, verify quests you've worked on, and more.
- Interacting with a Soroban sandbox, as well as the Futurenet, from within this
  gitpod workspace.

If you feel lost on any of that, you probably could use a refresher. Go ahead,
[be a pioneer][pioneer] once more. We won't judge!

### Join Us on Discord

We have a thriving, active, and *extremely* helpful Discord community! Join the
[Stellar Quest discord server][discord], and you'll find so many friendly folks
who will help get you on your way!
